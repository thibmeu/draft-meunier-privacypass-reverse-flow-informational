1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an instantiation of Privacy Pass Architecture
   [RFC9576] that allows for a reverse flow from the Origin to the
   Client.

   In other words, it specifies a way for an Origin to act as an
   Attester + Issuer.

2.  Motivation

   With Privacy Pass issuance as described in [RFC9576], once a token is
   sent by a Client, it is considered spent and cannot be reused in
   order to guarantee unlinkability.  If a token were to be spent twice,
   the two requests would be linkable by the Origin.

   However, requiring that all tokens are spent only once means that
   Clients might need to request more tokens for new requests, even if
   the request that included the original token doesn't need to "spend"
   that token from the Origin's perspective (due to the request ending
   up being insignificant to the Origin).  This draft provides a
   mechanism for an Origin to provide tokens, allowing reuse without
   reaching out to the initial Attester and Issuer.

2.1.  Refunding tokens

   Certain Origins use Privacy Pass tokens to rate-limit requests they
   receive over a certain time window because of resource constraints.
   If a Client sends a request that can be served without utilising that
   resource, the Origin would like to authorise them to do a second
   request.  This is the case for request requiring compute and the
   compute is low, or when the request leads to a redirection instead of
   content generation for instance.

   With a reverse flow, a Client that has already been authorised by an
   Origin can maintain that authorization, without losing the
   unlinkability property provided by Privacy Pass.

2.2.  Bootstrapping Issuer

   An Origin wants to grant 30 access for Clients that solved a CAPTCHA.
   To do so, it consumes a type 0x0002 public verifiable token from an
   initial Issuer that guarantees a CAPTCHA has been solved, and use it
   to issue 30 type 0x0001 private tokens.  Without a reverse flow, the
   Origin would have to require 30 0x0002 Issuer tokens, which have
   lower performance and a higher number of requests going to the
   Issuer.

2.3.  Attester feedback loop

   In [RFC9576], a Client gets a token from an Issuer and redeems it at
   an Origin.  However, if the Client's request is deemed unwanted by
   the Origin at redemption time, there is no mechanism that prevents
   the Client from going back to the initial Issuer to get a new token
   and be authorized again.

   With a reverse flow, the initial Issuer may require Clients to
   present an Origin-issued token before providing them with a second
   token.  This allows for a feedback loop between the Origin and the
   initial Issuer, without breaking Client unlinkability.

2.4.  Anonymous credential composition

   Privacy Pass Architecture as defined by [RFC9576] centers around
   tokens, which issuance flows are defined in [RFC9578].

   More recent explorations ([PRIVACYPASS-ARC], [PRIVACYPASS-BBS],
   [PRIVACYPASS-ACT]) are providing credentials to clients, which
   presentation result in a scoped token.  These schemes are more
   costly, and usage specific.

   With a reverse flow, the initial Issuer and the Origin issuer may use
   different credentials, which are suited to their use case.  One use
   case is rate limiting and blocking.  [PRIVACYPASS-ARC] provides rate-
   limit per origin with a unique credentials, while [PRIVACYPASS-ACT]
   allows to rate-limit a specific session once it's been established.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We reuse terminology from [RFC9576].

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

   *Flow:*  Direction from PrivateToken issuance to its redemption.  The
      entity starting the flow acts as an Issuer, while the end of the
      flow acts as an Origin.  The Client is always included, as it
      finalises the TokenResponse, and coordinate interactions.

   *Initial Flow:*  Issuer -> Attester -> Client -> Origin.  This flow
      produces a PrivateToken that is used by the Origin to kickstart a
      Reverse Flow.

   *Reverse Flow:*  Issuer <- Attester <- Client <- Origin.  This flow
      allows the Origin to issue a PrivateToken.  In the reverse flow,
      the Origin operates one or more Issuer, and the Client MAY provide
      these tokens either to the Initial Attester/Issuer, or use them
      against the Origin

   *Initial Attester/Issuer:*  Attester/Issuer part of the Initial Flow

   *Origin Issuer:*  Issuer operated by the Origin

   *Origin PrivateToken:*  PrivateToken issued by the Origin

   *Reverse Origin:*  An entity that consumes the Origin PrivateToken.
      It can be the Origin, or the Initial Attester/Issuer

4.  Architecture overview

   Along with sending their PrivateToken for authentication (as
   specified in [RFC9576]), Client sends TokenRequest

      Figure 1: Architecture of Privacy Pass with a Reverse Flow

   The initial flow matches the one defined by [RFC9576].  A Client gets
   challenged when accessing a resource on an Origin.  The Client goes
   to the Attester to get issued a Token.

   Through configuration mechanism not defined in this document, the
   Client is aware the Origin acts as a Reverse Flow Issuer.

   This is an extension of [RFC9576].  The redemption flow of a Privacy
   Pass token is defined in Section 3.6.4 of [RFC9576].  Reverse flow
   extends this so that redemption flow is interleaved with the issuance
   flow described in Section 3.6.3 of [RFC9576].  This is denoted in the
   diagram above by the Client sending Request+Token+TokenRequest(Origin
   Issuer).  The Origin runs the issuance protocol, and returns
   Response+TokenResponse(Origin Issuer).

   Such flow can be performed through various means.  This document
   introduces one to serve as example and first basis.

5.  TokenRequest, TokenResponse, and Finalisation

   In Figure 1, the Client sends an TokenRequest and receives an
   TokenResponse.  These are meant to abstract request from different
   protocol to the Issuer.

   As specified in Section 3.5 of [RFC9576],

      The structure and semantics of the TokenRequest and TokenResponse
      messages depend on the issuance protocol and token type being
      used.

   The introduction of Privacy Pass issuance protocol based on Anonymous
   credential, such as [PRIVACYPASS-ARC] or [PRIVACYPASS-ACT], modifies
   TokenRequest to use CredentialRequest instead.

   Upon receiving an TokenResponse, the Client has to finalise the Token
   so it can be presented to an Origin.  This may be a Finalisation for
   type 0x0002 as defined in Section 7 of [RFC9578], a presentation for
   Section 7 of [PRIVACYPASS-ARC], or even a refund for
   [PRIVACYPASS-ACT].

6.  Reverse flow with an HTTP header

   This section defines a Reverse Flow, as presented in Section 4,
   leveraging PrivacyPass-Reverse HTTP header.

   TokenRequest(Origin) and TokenResponse(Origin) happen through HTTP
   Header PrivacyPass-Reverse.  PrivacyPass-Reverse is a base64url
   ([RFC4648]) encoded GenericBatchTokenRequest as defined in Section 6
   of [BATCHED-TOKENS].

      The use of generic batch tokens as defined in Section 6 of
      [BATCHED-TOKENS] is because this already provides encoding for
      request and response, error wrapping, and a concise format.  One
      could use binary http or a new format

6.1.  Client behaviour

   Along with sending PrivateToken from the Initial Issuer to the
   Origin, the Client sends a TokenRequest as defined in [RFC9578],
   [BATCHED-TOKENS], or [PRIVACYPASS-ARC].  In all these definitions,
   TokenRequest MUST prepended by a uint16_t representing the token
   type.  The Client SHOULD consider Privacy Pass Reverse Flow like the
   initial flow.  The Client is responsible to coordinate between the
   different entities.  Specifically, if the Reverse Origin is the
   Initial Attester/Issuer, the Client SHOULD account for possible
   privacy leakage.

6.2.  Origin/Issuer/Attester deployment

   In this model, the Origin, Attester, and Issuer are all operated by
   the same entity, as shown in Figure 2.  The Reverse Flow is the same
   as the Initial Flow, except for the request/response encapsulation.
   The Origin is the Reverse Origin.

           |<----- Response+TokenResponse(Origin) -----+
           |                                           |

                     Figure 2: Shared Deployment Model

   Similar to the original Shared Deployment Model, the Attester,
   Issuer, and Origin share the attestation, issuance, and redemption
   contexts.  Even if this context changes between the Initial and
   Reverse Flow, attestation mechanism that can uniquely identify a
   Client are not appropriate as they could lead to unlinkability
   violations.

6.3.  Split Origin-Attester deployment

   In this model, the Attester and Issuer are operated by the same
   entity that is separate from the Origin.  The Origin trusts the joint
   Attester and Issuer to perform attestation and issue Tokens.  Origin
   Tokens can then be sent by Client on new requests, as long as the
   Reverse Origin trusts the Origin to perform attestation and issue
   Tokens.

                                                                              +--------------------------.

         Figure 3: Joint Attester and Issuer Deployment Model

   The Origin Issuer MUST NOT issue privately verifiable tokens, as this
   would lead to secret material being shared between the Origin and the
   Reverse Origin.

   A particular deployment model is when the Reverse Origin is the
   Attester/Issuer.  This model is described in Figure 4

                                                                              +--------------------------.

  Figure 4: Joint Attester and Issuer Deployment Model with reverse

   This deployment SHOULD not allow the Reverse Origin to infer the
   request made to the Origin, as it would break unlinkability.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   Privacy Pass [RFC9576] states

      In general, limiting the amount of metadata permitted helps limit
      the extent to which metadata can uniquely identify individual
      Clients.  Failure to bound the number of possible metadata values
      can therefore lead to a reduction in Client privacy.  Most token
      types do not admit any metadata, so this bound is implicitly
      enforced.

   In Privacy Pass with a reverse flow, Clients are provided with new
   PrivateTokens depending on their request.  They can spend these
   tokens to continue making further requests.

   While the token are still unlinkable, the token_key_id associated to
   them represent metadata.  It leaks some information about the Client.
   The following subsections discuss the issues that influence the
   anonymity set, and possible mitigations/safeguards to protect against
   this underlying problem.

7.1.  Issuer face values

   When setting up a reverse flow deployment, an Origin MAY operate
   multiple Issuers, and assign them some metadata to them.  The amount
   of possible metadata grows as 2^(origin_issuers).

   We RECOMMEND that:

   1.  Origins define their anonymity sets, and deploy no more than
       log2(#anonymity_sets).  This bounds the possible anonymity sets
       by design.

   2.  Clients to only send 1 PrivateToken per request.  This is inline
       with RFC9577 and RFC (Web Authentication) which only allows one
       challenge response to be provided as part of Authorization HTTP
       header.

   3.  Issuers metadata to be publicly disclosed via an Origin endpoint,
       and externally monitored.

7.2.  Token for specific Clients

   In Privacy Pass with a reverse flow, an Origin MAY operate multiple
   Issuers, with arbitrary metadata associated to them.  A malicious
   Origin MAY uses this opportunity to associate certain token values to
   a specific set of Clients.

   Let's consider the following deployment: the Origin operates two
   Issuers A and B.  The Client sends Token_A, and (TokenRequest_A,
   TokenRequest_B).  Issuer B is associated to croissant aficionados.

   If a Client requests croissant, or sends Token_B, the Origin provides
   TokenResponse_B.  If not, it provides TokenResponse_A.

   Over time, this means the Origin is able to track croissants
   aficionados.

   To mitigate this, we RECOMMEND:

   1.  The initial PrivateToken to be provided by an Issuer not in
       control of the Origin.  The joint Origin/Attester/Issuer model
       SHOULD NOT be used.

   2.  Clients to reset their state regularly with the initial Issuer.

7.3.  Sending more than one token

   While that's not part of Privacy Pass with a reverse flow, some
   deployment might consider allowing Clients to send multiple
   PrivateToken, similar to how normal Privacy Pass deployment allow two
   distinct PrivateToken to be sent.

   In Privacy Pass with a reverse flow deployment, there are as many
   bits as Issuers; each token is one bit.  We RECOMMEND to have a
   maximum of 6 Origins operated Issuers, bounding Client information to
   2^6 = 64.  Accounting for the initial Issuer, this means a total of
   log2(64)+1=7 Issuers.

   Origins should have sufficient traffic to not single-out particular
   Client based on timings of requests.

7.4.  Swap endpoint and its privacy implication

   With multiple Issuers, a Client MAY end up with a bunch of tokens,
   for various Issuers.  Origins MAY propose a swap endpoint at which a
   Client can exchange one or more Origin tokens against one or more new
   Origin tokens.

   The Origin SHOULD ensure this endpoint receives enough traffic to not
   reduce the anonymity sets.
