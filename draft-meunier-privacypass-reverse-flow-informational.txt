Abstract

   This document specifies an instantiation of Privacy Pass Architecture
   [RFC9576] that allows for a reverse flow from the Origin to the
   Client/Attester/Issuer.  It describes the conceptual model of Privacy
   Pass reverse flow and its protocols, its security and privacy goals,
   practical deployment models, and recommendations for each deployment
   model, to help ensure that the desired security and privacy goals are
   fulfilled.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an instantiation of Privacy Pass Architecture
   [RFC9576] that allows for a reverse flow from the Origin to the
   Client/Attester/Issuer.  In other words, it specifies a way for the
   Origin to act as a joint Attester/Issuer.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We reuse terminology from RFC9576:
   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9576#name-terminology

   New terminology is defined below

   Flow: Direction from PrivateToken issuance to its redemption.  The
   entity starting the flow acts as an Issuer, while the end of the flow
   acts as an Origin.  The Client is always included, as it finalises
   the TokenResponse, and coordinate interactions.  Initial Flow: Issuer
   -> Attester -> Client -> Origin.  This flow produces a PrivateToken
   that is used by the Origin to kickstart a Reverse Flow.  Reverse
   Flow: Issuer <- Attester <- Client <- Origin.  This flow allows
   Origin to issues PrivateToken.  In the reverse flow, the Origin
   operates one or more Issuer, and the Client MAY provide these tokens
   either to the Initial Attester/Issuer, or use them against the Origin
   Initial Attester/Issuer: Attester/Issuer part of the Initial Flow
   Origin Issuer: Issuer operated by the Origin Origin PrivateToken:
   PrivateToken issued by the Origin Reverse Origin: An entity that
   consumes the Origin PrivateToken.  It can be the Origin, or the
   Initial Attester/Issuer

3.  Deployment

   Along with sending their PrivateToken for authentication (as
   specified in RFC9576), Client sends TokenRequest

   +---------------+ +--------+ +--------+ +----------+ +--------+ |
   Origin Issuer | | Origin | | Client | | Attester | | Issuer |
   +---+-----------+ +---+----+ +---+----+ +----+-----+
   +---+----+ | | | | | | |<----- Request
   ---------------------------------+ | | | +-- TokenChallenge (Issuer)
   -------------------->| | | | | |<== Attestation ==>| | | | | | | | |
   +--------- TokenRequest ------->| | | |<-------- TokenResponse
   -------+ | |<-- Request+Token+TokenRequest(Origin Issuer)
   --+ | | |<-- TokenRequest ---| | | | |-- TokenResponse
   -->| | | | | |--- Response+TokenResponse(Origin Issuer)
   ----->+ | | | | | | |

   TODO: 1.  How are TokenRequest provided? 2.  How are TokenResponse
   provided? 3.  What are the error codes < binary HTTP sounds like an
   overkill, but fits.

3.1.  Client behaviour

   Along with sending PrivateToken from the Initial Issuer to the
   Origin, the Client sends one or more TokenRequest as defined in
   RFC9578 or draft-batched-tokens.

3.2.  Origin/Issuer/Attester deployment

   VOPRF recommended.  Origin is the Reverse Origin.

   TODO: Add diagram

3.3.  Split Origin-Attester deployment

   Uses BlindRSA, or SHOULD NOT VOPRF with a shared secret.  Origin is
   the Initial Attester/Issuer.

   TODO: add diagram

3.4.  Arbitrary batched tokens

   Allows for more than one token to be provided.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   Privacy Pass RFC 9576 states

In general, limiting the amount of metadata permitted helps limit the extent to which metadata can uniquely identify individual Clients. Failure to bound the number of possible metadata values can therefore lead to a reduction in Client privacy. Most token types do not admit any metadata, so this bound is implicitly enforced.

   In privacy pass with a reverse flow, users are provided with new
   PrivateTokens depending on their request.  They can spend these
   tokens to continue making further requests.

   While the token are still unlinkable, the token_key_id associated to
   them represent metadata.  It leaks some information about the Client.
   The following subsections discuss the issues that influence the
   anonymity set, and possible mitigation/safeguards to protect against
   this underlying problem.

4.1.  Issuer face values

   When setting up a reverse flow deployment, an Origin MAY setup up
   multiple Issuers, and assign them some metadata to them.  The amount
   of possible metadata grows as 2^(origin_issuers).

   We RECOMMEND that: 1.  Origin defines their anonimity sets, and
   deploy no more than log2(#anonimity_sets).  This bounds the possible
   anonimity sets by design.  2.  Client to only send 1 PrivateToken per
   request.  This is inline with RFC9577 and RFC (Web Authentication)
   which only allows one challenge response to be provided as part of
   Authorization HTTP header.  3.  Issuers metadata to be publicly
   disclosed via an origin endpoint, and externally monitored

4.2.  Token for specific Clients

   In Privacy Pass with a reverse flow, the Origin MAY operate multiple
   Issuers, with arbitrary metadata associated to them.  A malicious
   Origin MAY uses this opportunity to associate certain token values to
   a specific set of Clients.

   Let's consider the following deployment: the Origin operates two
   issuers A and B.  The Client sends Token_A, and (TokenRequest_A,
   TokenRequest_B).  Issuer B is associated to a croissant aficionados.

   If a Client requests croissant, or sends Token_B, the origin will
   provide TokenResponse_B.  If not, it provides TokenResponse_A.

   Over time, this means the Origin is able to track croissants
   aficionados.

   To mitigate this, we recommend: 1.  The initial PrivateToken to be
   provided by an Issuer not in control of the Origin.  The joint
   Origin/Attester/Issuer model SHOULD NOT be used.  2.  Clients to
   reset their state regularly with the initial Issuer.

4.3.  Sending multiple tokens

   While that's not part of Privacy Pass with a reverse flow, some
   deployment might consider allowing Clients to send multiple
   PrivateToken, similar to how normal Privacy Pass deployment could
   allow two distinct PrivateToken to be sent.

   In Privacy Pass with a reverse flow deployment, there are as many
   bits as Issuers; each token is one bit.  We RECOMMEND to have a
   maximum of 6 Origin operated Issuers, bounding Client information to
   2^6 = 64.  Accounting for the initial Issuer, this means a total of
   log2(64)+1=7 issuers.

   Origin should have sufficient traffic to not single-out particular
   Client based on timings of requests.

4.4.  Swap endpoint and its privacy implication

   With multiple Issuers, a Client MAY end up with a bunch of tokens,
   for various Issuers.  Origins MIGHT propose a swap endpoint at which
   a Client can use to exchange one or more Origin tokens against one or
   more Origin token.

   The Origin SHOULD ensure the traffic is important enough on this
   endpoint to not reduce the anonymity sets.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
